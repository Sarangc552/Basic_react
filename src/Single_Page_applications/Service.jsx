          Fragment is a design agency that provides services such as branding,
          design, and development. My responsibility was to design the agency's
          website. I found this project to be one of the most challenging I have
          worked on recently. This is a page designed by this agency's services
          department. The style of this project is different from my recent
          work, and that's why I was drawn to it. Let's work together on your
          project. You can reach me by email at: Amirbaqian@gmail.com
